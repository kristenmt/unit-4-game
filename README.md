Gem Game
In this gem game, there are four crystals. The computer will assign each crystal a random value between 1 and 12 for the entire game. This won't be displayed--each time a crystal is clicked, its value will be added to the current score. The computer will generate a target score. The user must determine each crystal's value and the best way to reach the target score without going over it.

The player wins when his/her current score is equal to the target score. The player loses if his/her current score is higher than the target score.
   
The game will restart with each win or loss. The computer will randomly choose a new target score as well as new values for each gem. Total wins and losses are tallied by the computer.

I created this game using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, and JQuery.
